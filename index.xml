      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>One of the main missions at G3S is to create a supportive gaysian community and foster mentorship and friendship as we explore our identities. To fulfill this mission, we started by creating a Tumblr blog to share and archive content relevant to our community. To facilitate closer interactions, we created a LINE chat group for chatting and more casual conversation. In addition to these platforms, we have created a mentorship program for people to interact and learn from each other in an even smaller group setting.</description>
