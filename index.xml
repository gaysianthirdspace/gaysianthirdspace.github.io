      <description>One of the main missions at G3S is to create a supportive gaysian community and foster mentorship and friendship as we explore our identities. To fulfill this mission, we started by creating a Tumblr blog to share and archive content relevant to our community. To facilitate closer interactions, we created a LINE chat group for chatting and more casual conversation. In addition to these platforms, we have created a mentorship program for people to interact and learn from each other in an even smaller group setting.</description>
